            <h4>Lens 1: 28mm f2.0 Wide Angle Prime Lens</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-darkgrey">Close up photo detailing any possible lens distortion:
                <img src="images/closeup.jpg" style="width:100%">
                No obvious distortion. The table, although at an angle, runs perfectly straight with
                no discernable fisheye effect despite being a wide angle lens. However, the tape measure
                laid out on the floor demonstrates that at 2 meters of focal distance, there is a lower
                field of view in comparison to the current camera. After taking measurements, it seems
                as though approximately 30 to 40 centimeters of the garden edges will be cut off.

            <p class="w3-text-darkgrey">Photo of plants ~2m away:
                <img src="images/plants1.jpg" style="width:100%">
                Again, we see no fisheye distortion.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-text-darkgrey">Lets take a look at a crop:
                <img src="images/plants1-crop.jpg" style="width:100%">
                This is a 1.56% crop. Yes, only 1.56% of the original image. Even at this resolution, 
                the image still maintains fair detail.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-text-darkgrey">Here is one more image:
                <img src="images/pond.jpg" style="width:100%">
            </p>
            <p class="w3-text-darkgrey">And a 1.56% crop:
                <img src="images/pond-crop.jpg" style="width:100%">
                At a longer focal distance, we begin to see more grain, but also consider this is 
                a longer distance than we would see in the AlphaGarden.
